h2. Overview

Today, it is not obvious how to apply version control to manage the resources in an Enonic CMS project. The Enonic Resource Tool is a tool to easen this task.

h3. Quickstart

1) Install gradle, one of the following:
* Windows: Download and install gradle from "gradle.org":http://www.gradle.org
* MAC: Install using "macports":http://macports.org or "brew":http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/

2) In you project directory, create a build.gradle file based on the sample file found here:
3) Run "gradle tasks" to see available tasks
4) run "gradle backupTest" to create local backup of test-server
5) run "gradle syncLocal" to fetch test-server to local disk

h3. ERT Workflow

A typical flow using ERT will be:

*Development*
1) Check out resources from version control to local disk
2) Check that development environment is up to date
3) Make changes to local files, apply changes to development environment as you go
4) Check in all changes to version control

*Test*
5) Check out resources to local disk
6) Run diff-task local -> test, verify changes
7) Run sync-task local -> test

*Prod*
8) Run backup-task to backup production to local disk
9) Check out resources to local disk
10) Run diff-task local -> test, verify changes
11) Run sync-task local -> prod
